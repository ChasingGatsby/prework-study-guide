# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to build a website where I could easily access information learned during the bootcamp. Seeing as there is going to be quite as bit of information, this website would allow me to catalog display the concepts we've been learning in an organized fashion.
Building this project has given me an understanding of the base-level processes needed to build a website via interaction with git and utilization of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
